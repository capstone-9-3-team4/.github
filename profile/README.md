## Description
Therapist Connect app is a platform that enables therapists to access up-to-the-minute mental health insights and to prioritize high-risk entries via a specialized journaling platform equipped with advanced AI technology. This also empowers patients to express themselves more accurately without having to say a word but writing it instead. This offers therapists valuable insights to inform their interventions during the periods between in-person sessions.

## Built With

## Features

- **Journal Entry Viewing with Sentiment Analysis**: The app indicates the emotional states of each entry with a sentiment analysis (high, moderate or low risk entries) via advanced AI technology and prioritizes each entries, so therapist (or any mental health professional) can access mental health between sessions.
